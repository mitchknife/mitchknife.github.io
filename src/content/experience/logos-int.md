Get paid to write code? Sign me up!

As an intern, I found that real code is messy and that code bases are *huge* and hard to navigate. Source control was confusing (didn't need that in school!), and two senior devs could rewrite (in a 30 minute whiteboard session) a feature that you poured your heart and soul into for days/weeks (and it was cleaner, simpler, and more performant!).

I learned that the lesson of the internship is not to ship code but to pull your head out of the school mindset and prepare you for what's to come. I loved every minute of it and I must say it was hard to go back to school for that last year, especially knowing I had a full-time position waiting for me when I was finished.
