I was the first dev hire after a two company merger. One product was built using Ruby and the other .NET. My role was to be the point person on the .NET team in charge of integrating the two development teams as much as possible. This meant creating common code repositories, build systems, cultivating a more robust culture of testing, and finding other areas in the development process that needed a little love. This is where my ability to jump right into to a messy codebase and find some order really started to shine.

- Moved the entire .NET code base from BitBucket to GitHub.
- Added many tests to the code base and refactored code in ways to be more testable.
- Created tooling for migrating MySQL databases to Azure
- Upgraded C# projects to netstandard/netcore
