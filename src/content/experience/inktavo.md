I was the first dev hire after a two-company merger. I was responsible for integrating the .NET team with the Rails team, establishing common workflows, and improving development practices.

- Migrated the .NET codebase from **Bitbucket to GitHub**, modernizing version control and CI workflows
- Improved **testing culture** by adding new unit tests and **refactoring for testability**
- Built tools to migrate **MySQL data to Azure** with minimal disruption
