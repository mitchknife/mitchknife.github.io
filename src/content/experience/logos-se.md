I started out my career working on the e-commerce site, but quickly moved to working on internal tools and web services backing our main desktop application.

- Rewrote a legacy e-commerce site written in WebForms to use ASP.NET MVC
- Built web services for **syncing documents** across client devices
- Moved all products and services to NuGet-based library management
