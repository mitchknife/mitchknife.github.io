As a full-time software engineer I transitioned from the (well defined) world of Desktop Software to the (more wild, wild, west) world of the Web. Here things could break for a miriad of reasons (and oftentimes no reason at all!). At first I worked on the E-Commerce website, but quickly began working on multiple other web services which interfaced with our primary desktop product as well as other internal tools used by contractors.

- Helped pioneer a rewrite of the old WebForms e-commerce site into the (then experimental) MVC framework
- Built and maintained web services used by the main desktop app, including a **client/server sync framework** meant to keep documents syncronized between multiple clients.
- Spearheaded the initiative to **move our entire suite of products and services to using NuGet** instead of manually handling libraries.
