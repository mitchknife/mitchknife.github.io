I currently work with a small, very talented team building a new legal tech document editor/generator. As part of a startup I have a good understanding of the tradeoffs between "getting it shipped" and "getting it done right". I work on all aspects of our app, from React on the frontend, to a sensible and scalable API using Fastify on the backend, to getting the whole thing deployed and ensuring our third party services are integrated well and humming along. I also wear the designer hat, the product manager hat, and the customer service hat, when needed.

- Built a **backend service layer defined with a separate DSL** (similar to OpenApi). Javascript clients, backend http controllers, and API documentation (markdown) are all generated from the one definition file. This allows us to be more intentional about our API design, integrate new routes into the client really fast (no boilerplate), and helps us abstract away the HTTP layer so unit tests can focus on testing business logic with zero setup for mocking HTTP or having to resort to integration tests.
- Integrated numerous **third party solutions** to offload whole sections of our app, like CRM, payments, emails, file storage, etc. This helps us move faster to market and allows us to focus on the most important parts of our product.
- Organized our entire codebase into separate private packages so that sharing code between projects is easy and intuitive.
- Met directly with customers to troubleshoot specific problems and work on useful features for them. As well, I would loop them back in as work gets completed to garner feedback.
