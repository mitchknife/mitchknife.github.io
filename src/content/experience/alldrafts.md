I currently work with a small, talented team building a new legal-tech document editor/generator. I handle everything from building the Node backend API to the React frontend app and maintaining deployments and integrations.

- Built a **backend service layer defined with a DSL** that generates JS clients, HTTP controllers, JSON schemas, and documentation from one definition file.
- Integrated numerous **third-party solutions** (CRM, payments, emails, file storage) to accelerate delivery and stay focused on core product.
- Organized our entire codebase into separate private packages so that sharing code between projects is easy and intuitive.
- Met directly with customers to gather feeback, troubleshoot problems, and talk through potential features.
