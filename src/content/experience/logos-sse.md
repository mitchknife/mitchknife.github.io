As a Senior Software Engineer I became more **autonomous**, capable of designing, building, and deploying entire systems and APIs on my own. I provided technical expertise and contributions on all of our major APIs and features (Payments, Accounts, Auth, Commerce, Desktop). I **mentored interns and junior devs**, teaching them the ropes about coding (and sometimes just life). I led multiple, end-to-end, feature teams which had roadmaps, schedules, design support, and direct stakeholder interaction. I was also comfortable in the nebulous world where direction was less clear and where design support was less prevalent. 

- Worked on a team to create the **[Logos Web App](https://app.logos.com/tools/text-comparison?reference=bible%2Besv.64.1&resources=esv%2Cnasb95%2Cniv2011%2Cnrsv%2Ckjv1900&view=Verses)** (written in the early days of React), making our primary Bible Study tool available on the web for the first time.
- Built and maintained an **API for handling online giving**. This involved interfacing with our **Payment Provider**, maintaining giving schedules, and creating a set of **embedded widgets** which customers could use on their websites.
- Helped to formally structure our different web properties into **Microservices**. This involved building out a **messaging system** so the services could communicate in a less coupled way, and eventually migrating them all to Azure.
