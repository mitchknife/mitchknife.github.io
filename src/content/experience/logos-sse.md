- Built the first versions of the [Logos Web App](https://app.logos.com) (early React + Redux architecture)
- Developed and maintained an API for online giving, including **payment provider integration** and giving schedules
- Helped migrate monolith services to a **microservice architecture** using **message queuing** and Azure cloud hosting
- **Mentored interns** during our summer internship program, helping them get the career boost I was given as an intern
